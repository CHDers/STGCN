# STGCN
The PyTorch version of STGCN implemented by the paper *Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks:
A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting*

## Paper
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875

## Other implementations
1. https://github.com/Davidham3/STGCN (MXNet)
2. https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18 (TensorFlow v1)

## Applications
According to the paper, STGCN could be applied into general spatio-temporal structured sequence forecasting scenarios. We find it could be used for PM2.5 prediction.
