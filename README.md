# STGCN
The PyTorch version of STGCN implemented by the paper *Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks:
A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting*

## Paper
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875

## Other implementations
1. https://github.com/Davidham3/STGCN (MXNet)
2. https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18 (TensorFlow v1)

## Applications
According to the paper, STGCN could be applied into general spatio-temporal structured sequence forecasting scenarios. We find it could be used for PM2.5 prediction.

## About GNN in STGCN
In my opinion, any GNN which be used for nodes classification could be implemented in STGCN. That's why I'm tring to implemented SGC and GFNN in STGCN. If you are interested in my experiments, please move to https://github.com/hazdzz/STGNN.
